# Snake-Game-Application

The aim of this game application is to collect the food, avoid obstacles
and gain maximum points. In this project, arrow keys are used to give
a direction to the snake. As and when the snake hits an apple (i.e
food) it will enlarge. The game ends when the snake hits itself or the
screen. This application is implemented using JAVA and Swing
